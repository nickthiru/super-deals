I need to integrate a new UX Pilot generated page into my SvelteKit project. Here are the details:

1. Target file path: [e.g., frontend/src/routes/merchants/sign-up/+page.svelte]

2. UX Pilot generated code:

[Paste the full UX Pilot HTML code here]

3. Special considerations:

   - Preserve existing functionality from [reference file path if applicable]
   - The page needs to [describe any specific functionality needed]
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling (already in UX Pilot output)

4. Integration guidelines:
   - Don't modify existing components in shared directories
   - Create backups (.bak) of any existing components before modifying
   - Extract color variables to app.css if needed
   - Move Google Fonts and other libraries to app.html
   - Organize components following our established structure
   - Preserve any existing business logic and form validation

Please analyze the UX Pilot code first and provide your integration approach before implementing any changes. I'm in chat mode, so we'll discuss before you write any code.
