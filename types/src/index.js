// Re-export all type modules
// As we add more type definitions, we'll export them here

// Import merchant types
// Note: We'll add specific type imports as we migrate existing types
// Example: /** @typedef {import('./merchants/index').MerchantSignUpData} MerchantSignUpData */

// Export empty object since JSDoc types are used for documentation only
